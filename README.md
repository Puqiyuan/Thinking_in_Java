# Thinking_in_Java
This repository is the records of learning of Thinking In Java book. It's main about codes
fragment in the book. Because the book don't note the chapter number, so I add chapter
number from Introduction chapter as chapter 1 for convenience, but I start recording from
chapter3, also known as Every thing is an Object.

The book is 4th ed.
